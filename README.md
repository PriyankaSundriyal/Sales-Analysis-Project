2.	Install the required dependencies:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
3.	Ensure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.
Data Description
The dataset used in this project contains historical sales data of a retail store, including:
•	Order ID: Unique identifier for each sale
•	Product: The name of the product sold
•	Quantity Ordered: Number of units sold
•	Price Each: Price of a single unit
•	Order Date: Date and time when the order was placed
•	Purchase Address: The location of the buyer
**Features**
The project includes the following key features:
•	Sales Overview: A summary of total sales, number of orders, and revenue generated.
•	Monthly Sales Analysis: Trends of sales over months to identify peak sales periods.
•	City-Wise Sales: Sales distribution across different locations.
•	Best-Selling Products: Insights into which products drive the most revenue.
•	Sales per Hour: Time-based sales analysis to understand customer purchasing behavior throughout the day.
•	Correlation Analysis: Visualizations showing relationships between variables like price and quantity ordered.
**Analysis & Insights**
1.	Monthly Sales Trend: Identifies the best and worst months for sales, providing a clear trend over time.
2.	Top Selling Products: Analyzes which products contribute the most to overall revenue.
